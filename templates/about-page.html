    <h1>About Page</h1>


        <p>
            I'm a junior full-stack web developer. I have an interest in Python backends and in particular
            the Django web framework. I have worked for many years as a third line support engineer, at both start-ups
            and enterprise level SaaS platforms. Now looking for my first oppurtunity creating software,
            as opposed to just helping to fix it!
